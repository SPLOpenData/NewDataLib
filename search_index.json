["roadmap.html", "2 Roadmap 2.1 Find your people. Make connections. 2.2 Skill up", " 2 Roadmap If you've just been hired as a data librarian, finding your way doesn't need to be a struggle. Here is a roadmap for your first months. 2.1 Find your people. Make connections. Who are the people in your organization who are working with data? Talk to them! Who was doing dataviz-related work before you got there? It may not have been officially part of their position, but talk to them! Was your position created because of the needs/requests of certain communities or people? Talk to them! Additional offices and groups to seek connection: Grants/funding offices Digital humanities/scholarship centers Particular disciplines (sciences/social sciences/stats, etc) Subject Librarians / Liaison librarians Local government Talk to the people who you found. Invite them to talk about their needs and the gaps they see in support AND the things that the library has already been helping with. If you're not in a primarily public-facing position, find opportunities to shadow librarians who are (in instruction, on the reference/public service desk/etc) Find your community beyond your institution Subscribe to listservs Go to public lectures/talks/etc If funding is available, attend conferences. Find other online communities (Data Librarians on Facebook; datacure; Twitter; etc) Find community groups who might be working with data beyond your institution 2.2 Skill up Read articles from our [Annotated Bibliography] Look through the curated training materials and use the ones that make the most sense for your position Watch for webinars/other online trainings on the listservs you subscribe to Find your community beyond your institution Subscribe to listservs Go to public lectures/talks/etc If funding is available, attend conferences. Find other online communities (Data Librarians on Facebook; datacure; Twitter; etc) Find community groups who might be working with data beyond your institution "],
["people-important-to-you.html", "3 People important to you 3.1 Directory at your organization 3.2 Other directories &amp; communities 3.3 Conferences", " 3 People important to you As a new data librarian, you will want to seek out fellow practitioners, mentors, and stakeholders in your organization and beyond. 3.1 Directory at your organization If directory keyword searching is an option, consider searching bios for: ‘research management’ ‘data visualization’ ’data services’ ‘data mining’ ‘metadata librarian’ ‘archivist’ ‘assessment librarian’ These initial contacts may provide further leads as you build your network. In this data era, increasingly you will find data allies in unconventional places. 3.2 Other directories &amp; communities If you want to look beyond your organization for peers, you might try to use a federated directory search and other networking tools. Here are a few federated directories and communities to explore. Table 3.1: Places to find external community. name link about IASSIST https://iassistdata.org From the site: “IASSIST is an international organization of professionals working in and with information technology and data services to support research and teaching in the social sciences. Its members are from a variety of workplaces, including data archives, statistical agencies, research centers, libraries, academic departments, government departments, and non-profit organizations.” Code4Lib https://code4lib.org From ‘About’: “code4lib isn’t entirely about code or libraries. It is a volunteer-driven collective of hackers, designers, architects, curators, catalogers, artists and instigators from around the world, who largely work for and with libraries, archives and museums on technology “stuff.” It started in the fall of 2003 as a mailing list when a group of library programmers decided to create an overarching community agnostic towards any particular language or technology.” R4DS/TidyTuesday https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday A loose, yet supportive nework of people interested in use of R language for data science. Direct2Experts http://direct2experts.org Consider searching for data librarians and other experts at nearby institions. Direct2Experts is a federated staff directory search across many academic and other institutions. You can search for keywords or specific job titles. Results are grouped by institution. ORCID https://orcid.org From the advanced search page, you can search for individuals by the keywords mapped to their Orcid profile. (Example keyword search: “Research Data Management”) ALA http://www.ala.org ALA has multiple, projects, programs and traingings where you may meet and build community with fellow data librarians. 3.3 Conferences Conferences are a great place to build your network. Try to be as social as you can. Go to postering sessions. Ask questions. Strike up conversations. Here are some conferences you might want to consider attending. Table 3.2: Useful conferences for data librarians. Name link about csv,conf https://csvconf.com/ “Featuring stories about data sharing and data analysis from science, journalism, government, and open source.” RDAP Summit https://rdapassociation.org/summit-info/ The RDAP summit is “ relevant to the interests and needs of data managers and curators, librarians who work with research data, and researchers and data scientists.” Code4Lib https://code4lib.org/ Library conference focused on technology, often with data sessions covering topics such as natural language processing, research data management, and more. Midwest Data Librarian Symposium https://mwdatalibrariansymposium.wordpress.com/ Academic data librarian unconference covering topics such as RDM, curating code, and more. IASSIST Conference https://iassistdata.org/conferences/iassist-annual-conference IASSIST describes itself as “an international organization of professionals working with information technology and data services to support research and teaching in the social sciences.” Research Data Alliance https://www.rd-alliance.org/ Research Data Alliance “provides a neutral space where its members can come together to develop and adopt infrastructure that promotes data-sharing and data-driven research” Library Assessment Conference https://www.libraryassessment.org/ A library conference of &quot;practitioners and researchers who have responsibility or interest in the broad field of library assessment&quot;.
